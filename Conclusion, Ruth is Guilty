We think Ruth did the crimes and here are the reasons

She claimed she was away for the entire week, but when we checked phone records we caught her within a 3/4 mile
radius at 2 of the crimes, and on Linden street during the time a breakin happened. she clearly lied about being away, for what reason?
She also owns all homes broken into, every single one, she might have knowledge of where things are and when the tenants are out.
When run through our program Ruth also comes up as the top suspect so we think its her.
